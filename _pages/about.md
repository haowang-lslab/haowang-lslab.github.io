Hi! I am a 3rd-year undergraduate at <strong>Zhiyuan College (Honor, Top 10%), Shanghai Jiao Tong University</strong>.
My academic journey has been enriched by several research experiences.
Currently I am mentored by <a href="https://cs.uic.edu/profiles/philip-yu/">Prof. Philip S. Yu</a>.
Most recently, I was a research intern at <strong>National University of Singapore</strong>, collaborating with <a href="https://www.zhaominwu.com/">Dr. Zhaomin Wu</a> and <a href="https://profile.junyi.dev/">Mr. Junyi Hou</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/">Prof. Bingsheng He</a>.
Before that, I worked as an undergraduate researcher at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, working alongside <a href="https://zhxie.site/">Mr. Zhihui Xie</a>, mentored by <a href="https://shuaili8.github.io/">Prof. Shuai Li</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6-ARmXsAAAAJ">Dr. Tong Yu</a>.
I've also had the privilege of collaborating with <a href="https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~blu/">Prof. Bao-Liang Lu</a> and <a href="https://weilongzheng.github.io/">Prof. Wei-Long Zheng</a>.

Besides research, I've excelled in competitive programming, winning awards in OI, ICPC, CCPC and various other contests, under the guidance of <a href="https://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu">Prof. Yong Yu</a>. See my <a href="assets/pdf/CV_Jizhou_Guo.pdf">CV</a> for details.

My research interests are primarily focused on Large Language Models and Foundation Models. I'm always eager to engage in discussions about these topics, so please feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat!

**Reward Inside the Model: A Lightweight Hidden-State Reward Model for LLM's Best-of-N sampling**

**Jizhou Guo**, Zhaomin Wu, Philip S. Yu

_Under review_

[[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12225)

- Proposed _ELHSR_, a highly parameter-efficient reward model leveraging the LLM hidden states, which **systematically outperforms baselines** with **less than 0.005% of the parameters** of baselines, resulting in orders-of-magnitude efficiency improvement.
- ELHSR also performs well with limited data, extends to logit-only training for certain closed-source LLMs, and can be combined with conventional reward models to yield further performance improvements.

**Model-based Large Language Model Customization as Service**

Zhaomin Wu\*, **Jizhou Guo**\*, Junyi Hou, Bingsheng He, Lixin Fan, Qiang Yang

_Under review_ 

[[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10481)

- Proposed _Llamdex_, a novel framework that facilitates LLM customization as a service for domain-specific applications.
- Achieved substantial performance improvements in domain-specific tasks, **boosting accuracy by up to 26%** while preserving privacy and maintaining efficiency on par with the base LLM.
